# CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum Project

_This project will allow you to claim the ownership of a star._
_Token is compliant with ERC721 Token standard for nonfungible tokens_

## Tools (and it's version) used for this project ‚öôÔ∏è

```
truffle v5.1.67
node v11.14.0
solidity v0.6.2
openzeppelin-solidity 3.4.0
web3 1.2.4
```

## Tasks ‚úíÔ∏è üìÑ

### Task 1

Your Project is to Modify the StarNotary version 2 contract code to achieve the following:
Add a name and a symbol for your starNotary tokens. Resource
Add a function lookUptokenIdToStarInfo, that looks up the stars using the Token ID, and then returns the name of the star.
Add a function called exchangeStars, so 2 users can exchange their star tokens...Do not worry about the price, just write code to exchange stars between users.
Write a function to Transfer a Star. The function should transfer a star from the address of the caller. The function should accept 2 arguments, the address to transfer the star to, and the token ID of the star.

### Task 2

Add supporting unit tests, to test the following:
The token name and token symbol are added properly.
2 users can exchange their stars.
Stars Tokens can be transferred from one address to another.

### Task 3

Deploy your Contract to Rinkeby
Edit the truffle.config file to add settings to deploy your contract to the Rinkeby Public Network.
Helper Points:
Command used to deploy to Rinkeby truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby
You will need to have your Metamask‚Äôs seed and Infura setup.
This was shown to you in detail in the lesson on Solidity, while creating ERC-20 tokens on Rinkeby.

### Task 4

Modify the front end of the DAPP to achieve the following:
Lookup a star by ID using tokenIdToStarInfo() (you will have to add code for this in your index.html and index.js files)
